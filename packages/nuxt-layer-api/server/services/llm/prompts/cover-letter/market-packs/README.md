# Cover Letter Market Packs

This folder contains market-specific prompt and presentation artifacts.

- `default.ts`, `dk.ts`, `ua.ts`: one file per market pack
- `types.ts`: shared type contract
- `index.ts`: active registry and getters

Market packs define:

- prompt guidance for letter/message by hiring market
- market-specific naturalness rules
- presentation date pattern (used with language date locale)
