Build a web app that helps a user tailor their resume for a specific job posting. The user signs in, uploads a base resume, and stores a structured profile they can edit. For each job, the user adds the job description (and optional link/notes) and generates an ATS-friendly version and a human-friendly version. The app supports role-based access: super admin (no limits), invited friends (higher limits), public (low limits), and BYOK users (they provide their own API key at their own risk). The app must enforce per-user daily usage limits and a global budget cap for platform-provided models, with an admin kill switch.
