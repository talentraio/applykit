# i18n guide (selective)

We enable i18n from day one to avoid painful refactors later.

## Rules

- No hardcoded user-facing strings in components/pages.
- Use translation keys consistently:
  - `home.hero.title`, `resume.upload.cta`, etc.
- Keep locales centralized (avoid per-layer locale folders in MVP).

## MVP approach

- Start with `en` as default.
- Optionally add `uk` early if needed.
- Ensure API errors returned to UI are displayable via i18n keys or mapped messages.
